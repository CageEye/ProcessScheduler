End-user:
=========

[X] Cumulative resources: resources that can process multiple tasks at the same time

[X] Optional tasks: tasks that may or may not be scheduled

[ ] Inventories: input/output for tasks

[X] Add a plotly/pandas gantt renderer with real dates and times

[ ] JSON importer/exporter for a scheduling problem

[ ] Export a networkx model to a set of tasks/taks precedences

[W] Voila based user interface

[ ] Add a penalty parameter to the Task class. And the related optimization (minimization) function.

Dev:
====

[ ] Performance benchmark

[ ] Improve class hierarchy and inheritance

[ ] Categorize task constraints

[ ] Developer guide, especially how to add constraints

Misc/unordered:
===============

[ ] Resource status. A status is a set of real/boolean parameters (for instance the position of a point, the heat of an oven). That would enable to create tasks that change a resource status, from example "Move a crane from point A to point B" or "heat the oven from 25°C to 1300°C", given a certain time or speed.

[ ] Test CapacityConstraint for cumulative workers
